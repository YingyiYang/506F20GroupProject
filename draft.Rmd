# **Introduction**
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every year close to 800,000 people die due to suicide which is one person every 40 seconds. The results of survey conducted by WHO in 2016 shows that suicide the third leading cause of 
death in 15-19-year-olds. More than 79% of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries which might be due to pesticide self-poisoning in rural agricultural areas. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of Poisson 
regression in modeling suicide count data using demographic variables such 
as age and gender and make inference on linear and non-linear combinations of regression coefficients. 

# **Data Description**
In this tutorial, we use the [1985-2016 Suicide Rates Overview 
Data](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)
which can be download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It is a compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place. It has 27820
records in total. The target variables we are going to analyze are:

`country`: country of the suicide records; 101 in total; countries in America 
and Europe occupy the majority 

`year`: year of the suicide records; range from 1985-2016.

`sex`: male and female   

`age`: age group of the suicide records; 6 groups: 5-14, 15-24, 25-34,
35-54, 55-74 and 75+

`suicides_no`: number of suicide  

`population`: total population of a country with given sex and year

`gdp_per_capita`: GDP per capita ($)
