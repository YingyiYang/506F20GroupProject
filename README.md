## Overview

Regression models tell us about the effect of predictor variables on the response variable, but to find out the effect of specific predictors on the response, we need to use linear combinations and draw inferences.

## Dataset

The 1985-2006 Suicide Rate data for 101 different countries and 6 age groups, found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)

## Core Examples

We used linear and non-linear combinations of predictor variables to draw inferences.

### Linear Combinations

* Do males or females have a higher effect on the suicide count in teenagers? 
* Are working-age females more influential on the suicide count than retired females? 

To answer these questions, we will build a poisson regression model and explore the effect of age, gender and year in pairs on the suicide count as a linear combination.


### Non-linear combinations
